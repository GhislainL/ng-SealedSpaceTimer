#Sealed space timer

Continuing my discovery of AngularJS, this application compute the time left in a sealed space.
The hypothesis used for calculation are :
* the time left (in hour) in a sealed space while resting can be computed by dividing the room's volume (m3) by the number of people inside and multiplying it by 1.5 (1)
* the average human volume is about 75 liters : the human body is almost fully made of water, 1 liter of water weight 1kg, the average humain body weight 75kg. For practical purpose, i rounded it to 100 liters. (2)

##Dependencies :
* The timer used is Angular Timer by Siddique Hameed : http://siddii.github.io/angular-timer/
* Angular-UI : https://angular-ui.github.io/
* Bootstrap
* The Bootstrap theme used is United provided by Bootswatch : https://bootswatch.com/united/
